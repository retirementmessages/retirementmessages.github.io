<h3>Retirement Messages for Colleagues</h3>

<p>
Think about a message or quote you could share on Facebook so that other colleagues can join in wishing them a happy retirement. Email and social media make it simpler than ever to send best wishes to someone for a big event like retiring. So keep this in mind when deciding on rye words or saying you're going to use.

<h3>Retirement </h3>

<p>
  Depending on the nature of the coworker retiring you could offer them a prayer for the best in their future. However you must be certain they would appreciate such a gesture - some people would find such a religious sentiment uncomfortable. But if you know them well enough then it would be a lovely way to spruce up a retirement card.
</p>

</div>
  
<ul class="heart">
<li>Stock up with lots of drinks, good music and delicious food – the biggest party of your life is about to start. Happy retirement</li>
<li>Happy retirement! You’ll be missed but never forgotten!</li>
<li>Wishing you a long and enjoyable retirement!</li>
<li>Best wishes on your next adventure!</li>
<li>If you put in as much effort enjoying your retirement as you have working with this company, it is sure to be a success!</li>
<li>The office will feel so different without you. You'll be missed terribly. But we're all happy for you. Enjoy your retirement</li>
<li>You have been a valued asset at this company, and we are sad to see you go.
If you put as much effort into enjoying your retirement as you have all the years you’ve been working, you’ll have an amazing, productive, dynamic and long lasting retirement. You deserve it!</li>
<li>Just wanted to say that I found so many of your ideas inspiring. It’s hard to imagine our workplace without you! I hope retirement brings you the chance to do whatever it is that you always wanted to do but didn’t get to. All the best!</li>
<li>I just want to say, “Thank You.” You always listened, you always had something constructive to say, and you always offered support and encouragement with an unflagging spirit. I’ve learned so much from you, and I will miss working with you. Keep in touch, please</li>
<li>This company grew because you were a very important part of it. Now that you are leaving we know that you will be irreplaceable and much as we would have liked you to stay on the time to say good bye has come. You will surely be missed</li>
<li>To say you will be missed seems like such an understatement. You are one of those rare people who instantly became a friend instead of “just” a coworker. There are no words to truly reflect how much we will miss working with you. Not to worry, though, I’ll stalk you on Facebook! Now, get out there and show the world just how much fun is possible
</li>
<li>You always dreamed of being your own boss and now it is finally happening. From today and onwards you are answerable only to yourself, take coffee breaks when you feel like, your lunch breaks can be as long as you want them to be, and best of all you don’t have to come to work at all. Happy retirement to you</li>
<li>Your guidance and encouragement have helped me and so many other coworkers thrive in a very competitive environment, and we’ve been so fortunate to have your expertise to rely on. You’ll be missed, but I know your retirement is the right thing at this time. May the next phase of your life bring you all that you seek and more</li>
