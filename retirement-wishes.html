<h2>What to Write in a Retirement Card</h2>

<p>
Writing an inspirational retirement message might seem difficult but can be done without you feeling too much stress. Your friends, family or coworkers will appreciate you taking the time to wish them a happy retirement. And some thoughtful, positive words can really help to settle any nerves about retiring and know the people they love will be right their beside them as they move into the next chapter of life.
</p>

<p>
We've compiled this extensive list of 100 retirement wishes to help you get the best message and hopefully inspire you to say something lovely. However if you want to write your own, with your own words, you can follow some simple steps.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Choose your words carefully, being respectful and sensitive to how the sick person is feeling is essential.</li>
<li>Be positive. Don't focus on the negatives of their illness. Try to lift their mood and make them feel better.</li>
<li>If you feel it's appropriate then you can use a <a href="/get-well-jokes/">joke</a> or funny message. Be careful though and certain they won't take offence at this.</li>
<li>Mention you are thinking of them. For a sick friend or family member to know they are in the thoughts of the people closest to them is a real lift.</li>
<li>If you can - offer support. A message saying you're going to visit them, bring food, something like that. Even small chores they may need doing would be a huge help.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Not to Say</h3>

<ul>
<li>Unless you know the recipient is religious then avoid a message of that nature. Saying "you'll be in my prayers" is absolutely fine but don't go further than that. You could make them uncomfortable.</li>
<li>Try to be as normal with them as you were before. They won't want to feel like they need special treatment or treated differently to before being ill. Just be the same with them as you always are.</li>
<li>Don't dwell on the illness or be negative. Stay upbeat, lift their spirits and keep positive for them.</li>
</ul>
