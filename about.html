<p>Knowing how to write the perfect retirement message or what to say in a retirement card can be difficult. Retiring is such a major event in our lives that we want to mark it in the best way possible, and we can do so by offering support and love whilst the person retiring comes to terms with the next part of their life. But the words we use should be reassuring, encouraging and supportive. </p>

<p>Putting our feelings and thoughts into words and on a card is where it gets tougher though. That's what this website is for. To help take the pressure off of having to come up with the wording for a message. You will find an extensive selection of retirement wishes for many circumstances and people. As well as <a href="/retirement-poems">poems</a>, <a href="/retirement-prayers">prayers</a> and <a href="/retirement-cake-sayings">cake messages</a> to go with your card and more. </p>

<p>So remove the worry and strain of writing a retirement message and leave yourself the time to focus on what actually matters - celebrating someone's retirement. </p>
