<p>
When we reach a certain point in our lives we begin to think about retirement. It can bring about a whole variety of emotions and feelings - some good, some bad. The luxury of being able to do what you want, when you want and not having to face the drudgery or hardship of work are some of the benefits of retiring. On the other hand you may be worried about having nothing to do, a lack of worth without a job or the financial problems that can arise from retirement. These are normal feelings for someone on the verge of retiring.
</p>

<p>
So if you are looking to wish someone a happy retirement you may want to add a bit of humour to your best wishes. Unfortunately many retirement quotes are quite negative and downbeat about retiring. They focus on the loss of mental faculty, the downside of a career and even death. But they don't have to. Retirement is often a time of happiness, laughter and fun.
</p>

<p>
So if you're struggling to find the words for a funny retirement message, or just want a laughable and irreverent take on retiring, try this collection of funny retirement wishes and quotes that will help see a friend or colleague heading off into the sunset with a smile on their face.
