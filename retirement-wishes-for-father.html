For many people retiring is a huge event in their, and their families lives. And when it's a father who has often sacrificed so much to provide for the family it takes on an even greater importance. It's his time to enjoy some well earned rest and relaxation and every family member will want to celebrate his big day. But that celebration can bring about a tricky situation - what do you say to your dad who's retiring?
</p>

<p>
You will undoubtedly want to wish your dad well on reaching a milestone as big as retirement, and probably talk about how much you appreciate all he's done for you. But it can be difficult for some people to fully express the way they feel about someone they're close to like their dad. Hopefully if this is the case then the example retirement messages provided below will help to wish your father a happy retirement and let him know just how delighted you are.
