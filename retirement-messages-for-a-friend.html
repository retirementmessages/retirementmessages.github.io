<h2>What to Write in a Retirement Card for a Friend</h2>

<p>
When a close friend retires it can be harder to know what to say to them than a colleague or acquaintance. As you have a deeper bond you will probably want to say something more meaningful. A good friend will appreciate you taking time to talk openly about how happy you are for them and all they've achieved. Plus with retirement being an anxious time for some, the support of a friend can make it seem less scary going forward. 
</p>

<p>
This resource of the best retirement wishes for a friend should help you get the perfect message for your pal and hopefully inspire you to write from the heart letting them know exactly how important they are to you. A touching and kind word to a good friend of yours will be appreciated as they start their new life.
