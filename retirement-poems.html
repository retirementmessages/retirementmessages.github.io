<p><strong>Irish Retirement Blessing</strong></p>

<p>May you always have work for your hands to do.<br>
May your pockets hold always a coin or two.<br>
May the sun shine bright on your windowpane.<br>
May the rainbow be certain to follow each rain.<br>
May the hand of a friend always be near you.<br>
And may God fill your heart with gladness to cheer you.

<p><strong>Happy Retirement</strong></p>

<p>Happy retirement days are here at last.<br>
The days of toil and stress are long past.<br>
I worked almost all my life so that I can play.<br>
Do I want to go back to work?<br>
Absolutely, no way!
</p>

<p><strong>The Day Has Arrived</strong></p>

<p>The day you thought you'd never see,<br>
Has finally arrived.<br>
And despite whatever you once believed,<br>
Gosh darn it, you're still alive.</p>

<p>You managed to survive your working years<br>
And retirement shines before you.<br>
Your spouse can nag you full time now,<br>
And your kids will still annoy you.</p>

<p>Yes, these will be your golden years<br>
To live life as you please.<br>
You can play golf and power walk at the mall,<br>
At least until you give out at the knees.</p>

<p>You can take up painting if you like,<br>
And spend all day painting flowers,<br>
That is until your hand cramps up<br>
After holding the brush for hours.</p>

<p>Don't worry about getting dressed every day,<br>
You've earned the right to stay in your pajamas.<br>
All you have to do is turn on the TV,<br>
And watch your afternoon dramas.</p>

<p>Sometimes life may get a little boring,<br>
Especially when you've no place to be.<br>
You can take up exciting hobbies,<br>
Like doing puzzles or watching birds sit in a tree.</p>

<p>Yes, retirement has its highs and lows,<br>
But there's one thing not to be forgot.<br>
As long as you're above ground and not below,<br>
Retirement's the better of the lot.</p>

<p><strong>Morituri Salutamas</strong></p>
  
<p>Age is opportunity no less,<br>
Than youth itself, though in another dress,<br>
And as the evening twilight fades away,<br>
The sky is filled with stars, invisible by day.</p>

<p>Today you will retire, <br>
And a new life will begin. <br>
May you have the time to do all you want, <br>
And may you feel the joy within.

<p><strong></strong></p>

<p>I love to write poems, <br>
So I wrote you a few poems you see. <br>
But I found it hard to choose which one, <br>
I would express my feelings for thee. <br>
My poems should share my congratulations, <br>
And how excited I am for you. <br>
My poems should tell you how proud I am, <br>
Without the overdue. <br>
So here's my poem to you. <br>
All my poems wrapped up into one. <br>
Congratulations on your retirement, <br>
May it be filled with adventure and fun. </p>

<p><strong>A Teacher's Wild Ride</strong></p>

<p>You're retiring from teaching,<br>
So, hold your head high.<br>
As you proudly proclaim,<br>
That you somehow survived.</p>

<p>Smug attitudes, disruptions,<br>
And homework excuses.<br>
Fart noises, spitballs,<br>
And gum chewing abuses.</p>

<p>The challenge was real,<br>
But the rewards are true.<br>
As you realize all that<br>
The kids learned from you.</p>

<p>You can smile and be happy,<br>
It's been quite a ride.<br>
Never forgetting those days when<br>
You just wanted to hide.</p>

<p>Still, you hope you made an impact,<br>
You hope for the best.<br>
But now you are ready for<br>
Some well-deserved rest.</p>

<p>It's hard to believe,<br>
That it's time to depart.<br>
But every one of those kids<br>
Will be forever in your heart.</p>

<p><strong>Teacher Time Check</strong></p>

<p>It's a time check like no other,<br>
When you teach for many years.<br>
To see your past students<br>
Sporting mustaches and beards.</p>

<p>It's hard to believe your students<br>
Have now grown.<br>
And have moved on to careers<br>
And families of their own.</p>

<p>When did this happen?<br>
There's just no way.<br>
It seems like it was<br>
Just flippin' yesterday.</p>

<p>But the final bell has rung and<br>
The pencils are down.<br>
You will miss each of your students,<br>
Even the class clown.</p>

<p>You'll retire happy with a few<br>
Grey hairs atop your head.<br>
But they are there to remind you<br>
Of all the students you led.</p>

<p>All those years of teaching,<br>
It's hard to believe.<br>
The fun and frustration,<br>
That's so hard to leave.</p>

<p>But it's the last day of school and<br>
You're exhausted and weary.<br>
It's time to move on<br>
Before you get teary.</p>

<p>It's been a long road<br>
And at times certifiably crazy.<br>
Now it's off to the beach<br>
To relax, unwind and be lazy.</p>

<p><strong>Now That You're Retired...</strong></p>

<p>Now that you're retired,<br>
We can spend more time together.<br>
Why you can drive me everywhere,<br>
Through all kinds of weather.</p>

<p>We can listen to the radio<br>
When you drive me to the mall.<br>
Drop me off at the door when it's icy,<br>
So I don't accidentally slip and fall.</p>

<p>When it's raining you can drive me<br>
To my best friend Sheri's house.<br>
Or take me to the dry cleaner's<br>
To pick up my favorite blouse.</p>

<p>When it's cold and windy, pick me up<br>
And drive me home from school.<br>
Just don't park too close to me and my friends,<br>
Because they think that parents aren't cool.</p>

<p>When it's sunny you can drop me off<br>
At my favorite beach.<br>
Don't worry, I'll call you when I'm done,<br>
So be ready and keep your phone in reach.</p>

<p>I can't wait for us to get started<br>
Hanging out now that you're retired.<br>
In fact, I'm sure there's more we can do,<br>
You really have me inspired!</p>

<p><strong>Retirement Verse</strong></p>

<p>For both of us know as we retire<br>
We can do anything we desire,<br>
There's time for us every day<br>
We start to get in each other's way,<br>
We love each other there's no doubt<br>
Travelling together out and about,<br>
Having interests of our own<br>
Has helped us to have really grown,<br>
We have a lovely family together<br>
So our lives are bonded forever,<br>
Looking back would anything change<br>
Answer is no, that would be strange.</p>

<p><strong>Inspiring Retirement Verse</strong></p>
  
<p>No alarms to set,<br>
No deadlines to meet,<br>
You can relax when you want to,<br>
Take the load off your feet,<br>
You can sit in the sun,<br>
Read papers all day,<br>
The world is your oyster,<br>
Time to do things YOUR way!</p>

  <p><strong>Challenges Of Retirement</strong></p>
  
<p> Retirement is like becoming a new mother, <br>
Without the hassles and challenges of raising a child <br>
You feel like you’ve been thrown into a different life, <br>
Far from what is familiar and wild. </p>

<p>Don’t worry if times feel strange at first, <br>
You’ll soon find your way. <br>
A little soul searching is all you need, <br>
Then you’ll certainly be more than okay. </p>

  <p><strong>Ulysses</strong></p>

<p>Come, my friends,<br>
‘Tis not too late to seek a newer world.<br>
Push off, and sitting well in order smite<br>
The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds<br>
To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths<br>
Of all the western stars, until I die.<br>
It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:<br>
It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,<br>
And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.<br>
Tho’ much is taken, much abides; and tho’<br>
We are not now that strength which in old days<br>
Moved the earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;<br>
One equal temper of heroic hearts,<br>
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will<br>
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.</p>

<p>So many worlds,<br>
So much to see and do,<br>
So little seen<br>
and done by others,<br>
means many more things<br>
to be seen and done<br>
by extraordinary you.

<p><strong>Time To Cheer </strong></p>

<p>You’ve done it, you did it, <br>
You're finally complete. <br>
No more alarm clocks or early mornings, <br>
And schedules are obsolete. </p>

<p>Now its time to do only, <br>
The things you love to do. <br>
Leave everything else at the door, <br>
Its time for your interests to pursue.</p>

<p>So enjoy these next few days, <br>
Where things will feel kind of weird. <br>
But don’t worry that will fade away quickly, <br>
And soon after all you will want to do is cheer! </p>

<p><strong></strong></p>

<p>Retirement is a time<br>
For making the most of being alive<br>
For you to live some dreams out<br>
When a new lease of life can thrive<br>
A time to do all those things<br>
That you always wanted to<br>
Retirement is a special time<br>
A time long overdue.</p>

<h2>Funny Retirement Poems</h2>

<p><strong>Get Back To Work!</strong></p>

<p>Retired is being twice tired, I've thought<br>
First tired of working,<br>
Then tired of not.<br>
</p>

<i>By Richard Armour</i>

<div class="poems">

<p><strong>An Ode to Old Age</strong></p>

<p>There's quite an art to falling apart as the years go by, And life doesn't begin at 40. <br>
That's a big fat lie. <br>
My hair's getting thinner, my body is not: <br>
The few teeth I have are beginning to rot. </p>

<p>I smell of Vick's Vapo Rub, not Chanel #5; <br>
My new pacemaker's all that keeps me alive. <br>
When asked of my past, every detail I'll know, <br>
But, what was I doing 10 minutes ago? </p>

<p>Well, you get the idea, what more can I say? <br>
I'm off to read the obituary like I do every day; <br>
If my names there, <br>
I'll once again start - perfecting the art of falling apart. </p>

<p><strong>Expiration Date</strong></p>

<p>With reluctance, we announce that<br>
(Name) has reached her expiration date.<br>
To remain here employed with us,<br>
It's simply just too late.</p>

<p>She knows that we'll all miss her,<br>
Well, at least a little bit.<br>
For as much fun as we've had you know,<br>
Sometimes she could be a twit.</p>

<p>But we jest, it's all in good fun,<br>
And we're sure she can take a joke.<br>
Just watch out friends in case she gets mad,<br>
'Cause we've heard she packs quite a poke.</p>

<p>In all seriousness, (Name), you know we love you,<br>
And simply want to say,<br>
Good luck with all your future holds,<br>
And happy retirement day!</p>

<p><strong>You're Retiring Today</strong></p>

<p>You're retiring today,<br>
And we want to wish you well.<br>
It may seem like you still work here,<br>
But a few signs will surely tell.</p>

<p>No more coffee cup rings<br>
On sub-standard reports,<br>
And when you're feeling surly,<br>
We won't hear your spicy retorts.</p>

<p>Your cubicle will no longer emit<br>
That oh-so-familiar smell,<br>
Of stale coffee, vapor rub,<br>
And day-old Taco Bell.</p>

<p>And when it's time for a meeting<br>
A tear will surely come to each eye,<br>
When you're not there to plop down in a chair,<br>
And heave a bored and world-weary sigh.</p>

<p>But let's not dwell on what we're losing,<br>
Because you're surely better off.<br>
Have fun wasting time off the clock now,<br>
And think of us fondly while you're goofing off.</p>

<p><strong>Have I Got Plans for You!</strong></p>

<p>Bet you thought your working days were finished,<br>
Now that your retirement has arrived.<br>
I've waited years to see this day,<br>
And my to-do list has multiplied.</p>

<p>All those jobs you said you'd get to,<br>
Once you could finally stop working,<br>
Have piled up high as a giraffe's eye,<br>
Say, why are you sputtering and jerking?</p>

<p>The living room really needs painting,<br>
And that garage isn't going to clean itself.<br>
And I think your den is just the place,<br>
To put up my new figurine shelf.</p>

<p>Let's talk about the backyard,<br>
It has been an eyesore for years.<br>
You should re-sod it and plant a few trees,<br>
Hey, why are you welling up with tears?</p>

<p>I guess you must just be so happy,<br>
To be starting your retirement this way.<br>
No wasting time feeling bored and useless,<br>
I've enough plans to keep you busy each day!</p>
