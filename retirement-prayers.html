<h2>Retirement Prayers</h2>

<div class="prayers">
<p>Dear Heavenly Father,</p>

<p>We come to you in thankfulness for the many years of service given by our friend and colleague who is retiring.  We thank you for the long term contributions they have made in the execution of daily tasks, in their loyalty to our organization and in their sharing of their experience and wisdom with others. </p>

<p>We are appreciative of their hard work and dedication. They have adapted to many changes over the years and have made sacrifices of their personal time when the job demanded it.  They have been a mentor and friend to their fellow employees and have worked faithfully despite their own personal obligations, joys and challenges.</p>

<p>We pray your continued blessings on them during this next phase of their life.  May your Presence be with them as they choose new paths and explore new horizons. May they be blessed with strong networks of friends and family to enjoy the journey that lies ahead. </p>

<p>Keep them vigorous in body, mind, soul and spirit. Open new doors of service that will satisfy their desire to give and that will make a lasting difference in our world. May they find many receptive hearts and minds for the wisdom they have to offer and many recipients to receive their love and care.</p>

<p>And so we end our prayer, thankful for what has been and grateful for what has yet to be.</p>

<p>Amen</p>

<div class="prayers">
<p>Dear God, you have given me so many blessings in my life, biggest of all my two beautiful children that turned out so well. For this I thank you.</p>

<p>With your help God and that of their mom, we managed to steer them and help them with opportunities to get them to at least some decent start in life. Bless them with abundance please.</p>

<p>But God, as my friends and family are preparing for and looking forward to their retirement in comfort, I have to start off once again, as so many times before. A whole lifetime of trying to acquire wealth and to be able not to look in others’ eyes at retirement age, has borne no fruits. I feel like giving up after so many attempts, but as You’ve given me the the strenght and courage before, to keep on trying and persevering, I know You will help me again.</p>

<p>Only, this time God, I ask that you shower me with the abundance that will also give me the opportunity to look forward to a carefree retirement.<p>

<p>Even though I don’t know how yet God, may I leave it in your hands to give me the guided path?</p>

Amen
</div>

<div class="prayers">

<p>I have come to an important cross-roads of my life and know that there are many unknown opportunities in the horizons of my life, and I pray that You would take my hand and guide me along the path that You would have me to go. </p>

<p>Thank You that Your word has been a lamp to my feet and a light to my path and as I now step out into the unknown, I pray that You would continue to guard and guide the way that I take - and thank You that You have scheduled every day of my life, including the unknowns in this retirement. </p>

<p>Lord I pray that this may be a wonderful new beginning for me and not the end of the road, that is so often the case when retirement arrives. Help me to seize every opportunity that arises and to explore the skills and gifts that You have given me, so that they may be used to glorify Your name. </p>

<p>I trust You Lord Jesus to be with me in sickness and in health, in poverty and in wealth and pray that I will submit day by day to the leading of Your Spirit and simply rest in Your love, knowing that You are my light and my life, my way and my end.</p>

Amen
</div>


<div class="prayers">

<p>Loving Lord, I thank You for the opportunity to step aside from the hustle and bustle of work-a-day living and for the opportunity to enjoy a slower pace of life, in the twilight years of my retirement.</p>

<p>Thank You for the way that You have led me and been with me throughout my busy working career and I pray that You will not forsake me now that life is about slow down as I face my forthcoming retirement.</p>

<p>Keep me I pray, from regretting the passing of my life and may I see this time as an opportunity to seek You more and to live in the expectation that You will open new horizons and opportunities to serve You in ways that will bring blessings to many and glory to Your name.</p>

<p>Help me Lord to see that as this one door on my past life is closing that the exciting door of my eternal future starts today. Thank You that I am Your child. Thank You that You died for me and that heaven is my ultimate "retirement" home and may I live the rest of my days in closer fellowship as I seek to do Your will in every area of my life, from this day forward - even for evermore.</p>

Amen
</div>

<div class="prayers">
  <p>Dear Heavenly Father,</p>

<p>Thank You for a season of rest following years of hard and fruitful labor. I pray that you would help me remember that as long as I’m alive on this earth, there’s no such thing as retirement from Your service. Keep fresh on my mind the responsibility I bear for stewarding well the time, talents, and treasure You have given me. May I use them always for Your glory. It’s in the name of my Savior, Jesus Christ, that I pray. </p>

Amen
