There a few things you should avoid saying in your retirement message. The last thing you want to do is upset the retiree and some of these phrases or words could do so.
</p>
<ul class="cross">
<li>Don't be negative. Stay upbeat and use encouraging words to make them feel more positive</li>
<li>Don't act or talk differently. They will want you to be as normal as possible with them. So write to them as you usually would</li>
<li>Don't be too religious in your message unless you know they will appreciate it. If you're in any doubt then err on the side of caution and stick with a regular message</li>
<li>Don't mention death! This should be obvious but all you will do is terrify and them. Avoid any mention of their mortality.</li>
<li>Don't use phrases like "everything happens for a reason" or "God has a plan". These sorts of sentiments can be offensive and not what someone who is ill will want to hear.</li>
