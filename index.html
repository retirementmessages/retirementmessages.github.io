<h2>What NOT to say in a Retirement Card</h2>
<p>
There a few things you should avoid saying in your retirement message. The last thing you want to do is upset the retiree and some of these phrases or words could do so.
</p>
<ul class="cross">
<li>Don't be negative. Stay upbeat and use encouraging, positive phrases and  words to make them feel more confident</li>
<li>Don't mention death! This should be obvious but retirement should mean a new beginning, and is nothing to do with dying</li>
<li>Don't use anything religious in your message unless you are confident they will appreciate it. If you're in any doubt then just stick with a regular message</li>
<li>Don't act or talk differently. Retirement is just finishing work, nothing more, so they will want you to be as normal as possible with them. So write and talk as you usually would to them</li>
</ul>
